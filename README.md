# amr-smr-sim

The code will appear as the course progresses and will be divided into parts as follows:

1. SMR movement mechanics
2. Road definition
3. Artificial sensors
4. Collision detection
5. Traffic simulation
6. Neural network
7. Visualizing neural networks
8. Optimizing neural networks
9. Fine-tuning
10. Live stream variant

### 1. SMR movement mechanics

- add lane
- add smr sprite
- add controls to move forward, backward, left and right

### 2. Road definition

### 3. Artificial sensors

- add Lidar with lazer visualization

### 4. Collision detection

- add polygon
- add damage access

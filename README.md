# amr-smr-sim

The code will appear as the course progresses and will be divided into parts as follows:
  01. SMR movement mechanics
  02. Lane definition
  03. Artificial sensors
  04. Collision detection
  05. Traffic simulation
  06. Neural network
  07. Visualizing neural networks
  08. Optimizing neural networks
  09. Fine-tuning
  10. Live stream variant

### 01. SMR movement mechanics
  * add lane
  * add smr sprite
  * add controls to move forward, backward, left and right
